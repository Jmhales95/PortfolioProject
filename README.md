# PortfolioProject
# This project is an overview of different measurements of COVID-19 data, such as comparisons between total cases vs deaths, mortality rates in specific locations, countries with the highest infection rate in conjunction with their population, and more. The project data is then prepared to be exported to Tableau for a better visualization.
